A lone pilot survived a harrowing attack in the Void and claims to have seen an intact chunk of the alien homeworld drifting in space with an entire city still intact on it. Many consider him to be suffering from space madness, but what about his story makes you believe him? Why does humanity need to find this place before the aliens do?"
