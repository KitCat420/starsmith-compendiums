If you do and score a strong hit, for the rest of the scene, add +1 any time you make a move leveraging that sensor lock. The sensor lock is lost when you roll a 1 on the action die on any move against the target. On a weak hit, the same as above but the sensor lock is lost when you roll a 1, 2, or 3 on the action die on any move against the target. You may only have a sensor lock on one target at a time.</p>",
