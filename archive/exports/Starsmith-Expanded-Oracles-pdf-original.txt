EXPANDED ORACLES

My goal in creating the expanded oracles presented here was to

give more options to the existing oracles. Nearly all oracles now

have triple the results where possible. You still roll 2d10 for

oracle results but also roll your action die (1d6). Use the table

with the corresponding 1d6 result denoted by dice symbols in

the tables such as 1 2 or 3 4 or 5 6.

I prefer larger grain oracles with many options rather than lots

of specific oracles with few options.  Hence, the expanded

oracles you now hold deepen current oracles rather than adding

all new oracles.

That being said, there are a couple of oracles that I've created

and use myself often enough to justify including.

  Random NPC Conversation - I like getting a

  mundane conversation to write out dialogue of fluff.

  Plus, it may turn out to connect to the story later on

  depending on dice rolls.

  NPC Plot Information - I don't like thinking up plot

  points for NPCs to give me ahead of time. I want

  surprise, and this oracle helps me do that. For additional

  mystery, play in such a way that this information may or

  may not actually be true. It's just what an NPC thinks is

  true at the time, an NPC lie, or some random piece of

  data pulled from a corrupted data stream.

  Item of Narrative Significance - In my Ironsmith

  supplement, I added a section for Items of Narrative

  Significance to help with mystery vows. I liked that there

  were just some random items that you now had to

  connect to the plot in some way. This helped to send the

  plot in a new direction, and now those tables tie nicely

  together with the STORY CLUE oracles in Starforged.

Thanks to Shawn's generous licensing, all the original oracles are

included in this book as well. That way you don't have to flip

back and forth between books or PDFs. Thank you, Shawn!

8            STARSMITH: EXPANDED ORACLES
CAMPAIGN

This section of oracles is intended  for use at  the beginning of

your campaign to help set-up your    character.  You will find the

following oracles here:

  Backstory Prompts - What happened in your past

  that set you on the path of wandering the stars?

  Starship History - How did you acquire a starship of

  own?

  Starship Quirk - What is an odd and unique

  characteristic of your starship?

  Sector Trouble - Within your starting sector, what

  trouble is happening that might give you a hook to get

  involved? This may only be background happenings as

  you deal with your inciting incident.

  Inciting Incident - What specific event is happening

  right now that you need to deal with? This is likely your

  first vow other than your overall background vow.

While these oracles are intended for use at the time of character

and sector creation, you can use them throughout your

campaign. In particular, you might find the Sector Trouble and

Inciting Incident oracles useful if you feel stuck for a direction.

CORE

The Core oracles are the heavy lifters for your campaign. Any

time you need more specific details that one of the other oracles

can't provide, you roll on one of these two oracles.

"But there are four oracles here?" you may ask. Yes, that is true.

However, the Action and Theme oracles are always rolled as a

pair as are the Descriptor and Focus oracles. Here's when you

use them:

  Action/Theme - Roll these when you need to know

  something that is not physical in nature. For example,

  you might answer these questions:

           Why would this character betray their patron?

           What purpose does this infernal machine serve?

           What secret is being kept?

  Descriptor/Focus - Roll these when you need to           know

  something that is physical in nature. For example,       you

  might answer these questions:

           What is in the abandoned building?

           What is the raider vessel hauling?

           What is the nature of this temple?

These oracles function quite well on their own to spark your

imagination, so if you find yourself overwhelmed with the sheer

volume of oracles that Starforged has to offer, just trim down to

these. You can answer any question you'll ever have with these

two oracle sets and still not get repeats very often thanks to the

expanded tables found here.

                                                                    CORE

SPACE ENCOUNTERS

Use these oracles when you encounter something out in the

open expanses of space. Not sure what your starship's sensors

are picking up? Find out here!

          Space Sighting - The results of this oracle are

          something you would find within a solar system such as

          asteroid belts or nebula.

          Sector Name - Roll for both a prefix and a suffix to

          create the name.

          Stellar Object - The majority of results here are types

          of stars you might encounter within a sector, but it can

          also be crazy objects such as a Dyson sphere or

          ringworld.

          Peril/Opportunity - At times, you'll be asked to roll for

          a peril or opportunity while exploring waypoints.

These oracles introduce two new notations. The first is the

Terminus, Outlands, and Expanse designations. These are for

specific regions within the Starforged setting. If you are using

these oracles for another game, it is enough to know that

Terminus is the safer, more highly populated region and the

Expanse is the most dangerous, sparsely populated region with

the Outlands in between. Choose your region, then roll for

results.

The second notation is the  symbol. When you see this, it

means you should roll on the given oracle for the result.

For example, if you roll on Space Sighting and get Planet,           ENCOUNTERS

you would then start rolling on the Planet oracles to find the true              SPACE

result of your original sighting in space.

PLANETS

When you encounter a planet, roll on these oracles to find out

more about it. Start with the Planetary Class oracle below, and

then move on to the oracles of that specific planet class. Within

the oracles for each class, you'll find the following:

      Atmosphere/Life/Settlements - These tables are

      not expanded since they are static, so just roll your

      percentile. Note that the Life oracle is independent of

      the Settlement oracle meaning that a planet could

      have no natural life but someone still built a settlement

      there anyway.

      Observed from Space - This is what your ship's

      sensors or a just a glance out the window would tell you

      about the planet below.

      Planetside Feature - A general region you might find

      while down on the planet.

      Name - A name for the planet that goes with the general

      theme of the class.

You also get a brief description of the planet class and a potential

quest starter that would work there.

         DESERT WORLD

         An arid land devoid of most life

         stretches around the globe. If there

         is any vegetation, it is sparse at best

         as few plants can survive the

         choking sandstorms.      Rocky sea

         beds now filled with sand hint that

         water once covered large areas of

         the surface centuries or millennia

         ago.    The utter desolation is

         forbidding.

         Quest Starter: Your ship's recycler has gone out leaving you very

         little water. Can a fresh source of water be found or at least

         enough to get you to the next planet? A structure not made by

         nature sits in the midst of a sandstorm. Does it hold salvage that

         can be used to fix your recycler?

         FURNACE WORLD

         Volcanic ruptures dot the surface of

         this planet allowing lava, ash and

         gas      to  escape         from  magma

         chambers deep within the core. The

         sheer volume of fiery lava casts an

         eerie red glow onto anything in

         orbit.       Steam swirls through the

         atmosphere          creating      massive

         weather systems.

         Quest Starter: The largest supervolcano on this planet is said to

         house a fissure in space known as "Hell's Gate." Where is it said

         that this gate leads, and why do you need to get there?

         husk.     Ruins, battlefields, and

         PLANET

         ICE WORLD

         A world blanketed in snow, winter

         has come and never leaves. Vast

         tundras sprawl across the surface

         while continent-sized glaciers carve

         out whole mountain ranges. Even

         from orbit it is difficult to tell

         whether one area is a landmass or

         just a large snowstorm. Parts of the

         ocean flash froze leaving waves of

         ice behind.

         Quest Starter: It is rumored that this planet houses what some call

         "living ice" which may be a new state of matter entirely. If this is

         true, it could mean a step forward in scientific knowledge and

         revolutionize how water is stored for trips in the Expanse. What

         faction is trying to keep this discovery unknown and why?

         Dense     forests    and  tangled

         vegetation cover more primeval

         growth from millennia past all over

         the surface of this planet. Life here

         is savage and fierce, fighting to

         thrive and not just survive. What

         secrets the rain-soaked canopy

         hides is anyone's guess, but the

         diversity of life here suggests there

         will indeed be secrets.

         Quest Starter: The rare ironwood tree is said to grow on this

         planet. How it was transplanted here is unknown, but proof of its

         existence has shown up in backroom trade centers. What is

         significant about the ironwood, and why do you need a sample?

         OCEAN WORLD

         Ocean worlds may be an endless sea

         of water, but some are made up of

         other   thalassogen      such   as

         ammonia, lava, or hydrocarbons.

         Other ocean worlds have their

         worlds contained between two icy

         spheres: a top layer protecting the

         water from solar radiation and a

         lower layer protecting the water

         from the planet's core.

         Quest Starter: The water world below is home to an extremely

         large and powerful geyser that has been in a state of constant

         eruption for years. If that power could be harnessed, it would

         produce cheap and nearly infinite energy. Which factions are

         vying for control of this geyser, and what is your stake in this?

         ROCKY WORLD

         All rocky planets have a metallic core

         , but the type of rock that dominates

         on their surface can be silicon-based

         or carbon-based.       Either type of

         surface can be hostile to life and

         treacherous to traverse.  These

         planets may be a source of minerals,

         but the environment is unforgiving.

         Quest Starter: The Knowledge Preservation Society attempts to

         gather knowledge critical to the functioning of society and

         document historical events in case of another cataclysmic event.

         They claim to have found a rocky gateway they call the Sentinel of

         Eternity on the planet below which can send them back in time to

         prevent the first cataclysm. Why must you stop them?

         SHATTERED WORLD

         Destructive forces have torn this

         world to pieces. Chunks of earth

         and debris orbit around larger

         sections of the remaining partial

         planet.  The planetary core is no

         longer in tact and bleeds out into

         space. What caused this destruction

         is unknown, but if it is still around, it

         is surely dangerous.

         Quest Starter: Competing corporate mining factions are having a

         proxy war over the rights to harvest the minerals from the

         shattered planet below turning the whole area into a battlefield of

         skirmishes and raids. Why are you determined to see one side

         fail, and what do you think you will find hidden in the planetary

         debris?

         TAINTED WORLD

         The      evolution     of   life  itself  is

         responsible for the death of this

         planet.      Whether a civilization

         greedily consumed the planetary

         resources thereby polluting the

         world    or  a      dangerous     micro-

         organism proliferated rapidly, the

         result is the same: a planet of death.

         Quest Starter: The world below was abandoned a hundred years

         ago as uninhabitable, but some of the descendants of the original

         inhabitants are attempting to gather cultural artifacts that may

         still be intact on the surface. What artifact in particular is

         important to you, and why?

         VITAL WORLD

         Against all odds, life finds a way.

         Even in the emptiness of space, tiny

         pockets of hope can be found, and

         this planet offers that. Liquid water

         exists here which has given a chance

         for both flora and fauna to flourish.

         If you can't find exactly what you

         need here, you can at least find a

         moment of respite.

         Quest Starter: The planet below has been declared by most

         recognized governments as a sanctuary due to the presence and

         diversity of life that was found on the planet's discovery. A group

         of corporate elites has contracted a pirate crew to smuggle them

         onto the planet for an illegal big game hunt. Which corporate

         leader on this trip is significant to you, and why?

Since this is a vital world, you'll likely want to generate some lifeforms.

For the fauna (animals), you should use the original STARFORGED

creature oracles, but I thought it would be nice to have a quick flora (plant)

oracle as well. To use this oracle, roll percentile dice and your action die

(D6) together treating the tens digit of the percentile as separate from the

ones digit.

             SETTLEMENTS

             When you encounter a settlement, use these oracles to get more

             information about it. The oracles include:

               Location/Population - If you know there is a

               settlement in the sector but aren't sure where, use the

               Location oracle. Note that the Population oracle is

               split by region.

               First Look/Initial Contact/Authority - These oracles

               give you a first contact situation with a settlement. What

               do you see from the outside? How does their

               representative respond to you? What is their authority

               structure (which can change how you access the

               settlement)?

               Settlement Projects - If the settlement needs help on

               something they're working on, this will tell you that

               project.

               Settlement Trouble - A wrong that needs to be

               righted. Perhaps you can help?

               Name - A basic name generator using spacey names.

SETTLEMENTS  You also get a brief description of the planet class and a potential

             quest starter that would work there.

           STARSHIPS

           Use these oracles when you encounter another starship.

                Type - This gives you general class of a ship and it's

                role. Feel free to add an identifier code like a Hunter-1A

                class as you run into multiples of the same class to give a

                bit of differentiation.

                Fleet - Perhaps you rolled a miss with a match and a

                whole fleet of ships on an intercept course just showed

                up on radar. This will give you the nature of that fleet.

                Initial Contact - What contact with this ship is like.

                First Look - The thing you notice first.

                Mission - You may not find out this information unless

                the contact goes well, but it's here if you need to know

                what mission the ship or fleet is on.

                Name - Every ship needs a good name! Well, almost. If

                you want a registry number instead, try the table below.

STARSHIPS  REGISTRY NUMBER BUILDER

           1d6 Initializer letters                        4d10  1d6 Model

           1    CCV - Custom Commissioned Vessel                   1        A

           2    RTV - Registered Terminus Vessel                   2        B

           3    NCC - Naval Corps Contracted              i.e.     3        C

           4    USS - United Star System                  3749     4        D

           5    DFX - Deep Forge Experimental                      5        E

           6     Use Faction Initials                              6               J

           To build a registry number, roll your challenge dice (2d10) and

           action die (1d6) twice. The first d6 gives the initializer letters and

           the second gives your final model letter. The two challenge dice

           rolls together make up the numbers.

           For example, rolling 25 (2d10) and 4 (1d6) followed by 81 (2d10)

           and 3 (1d6) yields the USS-2581-C.

CHARACTERS

Whether creating your own player character or building an NPC,

you can use these oracles to figure who each character is and

what makes them tick.

  First Look - The first characteristic you notice about

  this person.

  Initial Disposition - Their attitude towards you, at least

  at first. I'm sure they'll love you once they really get to

  know you. You didn't really mean for that engine core to

  go critical with their family on board, did you? Nah...

  Initial Contact - What contact with this ship is like.

  Character Role - The person's primary job.

  Character Goal - The thing that motivates them.

  Revealed Character Aspect - As you continue to talk

  to this person, they show you more about who they are.

  Name - There are three oracles for building a name: the       CHARACTERS

  Given Name, Family Name, and Callsign that they

  go by.

  Random Conversation Topic - Want to just shoot the

  bull with an NPC? Roll on this table to see what they

  want to gab about.

  Plot Knowledge - Many times you know that an NPC

  can tell you something important about the plot, but you

  don't know what. Roll on the Type and Topic oracles

  and put the results together to figure out just what this

  NPC can tell you. Of course, you could use this for when

  you find information hacking a database as well.

NPC PLOT KNOWLEDGE

The following two pages give you a way for NPCs to provide vital

plot information without you having to know it ahead of time.

Roll on the TYPE table and the TOPIC table, and then put the

two results together to see what the NPC can tell you. If you

need help interpreting this information, you may make an

ACTION/THEME roll or a DESCRIPTOR/FOCUS roll.

This information could also be something that you find in a

database, hacked datapad, or back channel forum. It doesn't

necessarily have to come directly from an NPC.

  strong or wide their influence is. After you know their

  type, you then roll on the corresponding oracles. Note

  that for the Dominion type, you roll on both the

  Dominion and Leadership oracles, although I use the

  Leadership oracle for all factions.

  Projects - This tells what the faction has been working

  on lately.

  Relationships - This oracle can tell you how two

  different factions relate to one another. Pick two faction      FACTIONS

  and then roll.

  Name - First roll on the Name Template table to find

  the pattern that the name takes and then roll the

  corresponding pieces to form the full name.

  Quirk - This is some notable behavior that the faction

  partakes in.

  Rumors - What the word on the street is about this

  faction. Rumors can be a good place to get ideas for

  new vows or missions.

DERELICTS

When you come across an abandoned location to explore, it is

called a derelict.

  Location/Type - Derelicts can be abandoned starships

  or abandoned settlements that could be on a planet, in

  orbit, or adrift in space.

  Condition - The condition the derelict is in when you

  first find it.

  Outer First Look - What you notice from an outside

  inspection or scan.

  Inner First Look - If you go inside the derelict, this is

  the first thing you notice.                                       DERELICTS

  Zones - When exploring a derelict, you end up in

  different zones of the ship or settlement. You first roll

  for the zone, and then look at the corresponding zone

  oracle which gives you a general Area that you are in,

  Features you notice, and a Peril or Opportunity as

  they are called for.

While I did expand the Outer and Inner First Look tables, I did

not expand the Zone tables. Instead, I altered the Zone tables

to be for city districts within a mega-city structure. You'll find

those oracles in the next chapter.

           DISTRICTS

           Districts are sections of a large mega-city which can be explored

           much like a Derelict or Vault. Characters can easily get lost in

           the twists and turns of an unfamiliar city, and these districts

           provide the backdrop for characters to explore.

           When you need to see what type of district you are in, you may

           roll on the table below to get the general theme of the Zone. If

           that is enough to spark your imagination, stop there. If you need

           more details, you can roll on the corresponding zone oracle.

           The only difference from the derelict oracles is that I eliminated

           the option for "New zone" by itself on the area oracles which

DISTRICTS  allowed for an extra entry in the oracle. Therefore, when you roll

           the "New zone via Access", you can choose to roll on the Access

           oracle or not.

           Finally, if you need a FIRST LOOK oracle, use the one from the

           SETTLEMENTS section.

        VAULTS

        When you encounter the strange, weird, or mysterious remnants

        of an ancient alien species, you are encountering a Precursor

        Vault. Use the tables to explore from the exterior to the interior

        to the inner sanctum in search of wonders.

        NOTE: Some of the shapes are not immediately recognizable

        (such as a Kepler-Poinsot shape), but I would encourage you to

        Google them. They are real shapes and some are quite stunning.

          Location - If you know you have found a vault in a

          sector but don't know where, roll here.

VAULTS    Scale/Form/Shape/Material/Outer First Look -

          Combine the results from these oracles to get your first

          understanding of this alien place.

          Inner First Look - What you see when you first get

          inside.

          Vault Purpose - While your character may not know

          the vault purpose until they are in the inner sanctum or

          other narratively appropriate time, you might find it

          helpful to know the purpose of the place as you envision

          the inner workings of this place.

          Interior Feature/Peril/Opportunity - As you

          continue your journey ever deeper, use these oracles.

          Sanctum Feature/Peril/Opportunity - Once you

          breach the inner sanctum, use these oracles to finish

          your exploration.

CHAPTER C1H4A|PM TEISRC1E5LL|AMNEOOVUES ORACLES  287
       MOVES

       There are a few moves that contain oracles within the move itself

       that I felt would benefit from having expanded oracles. They are:

         Ask the Oracle - Getting a result with a match makes it

MOVES    an extreme yes or no, but I like having a partial yes or no

         answer sometimes known as a "yes but" or "no but".

         Confront Chaos - When exploring a waypoint and

         scoring a miss with a match, something campaign

         changing can happen.

         Make a Discovery - When exploring a waypoint and

         scoring a strong hit with a match, something wondrous

         is discovered.

         Pay the Price - When you experience a negative

         outcome but aren't sure what it is, use this move.

288      STARSMITH: EXPANDED ORACLES
ASK THE ORACLE

When you need an answer to a yes/no question, use the oracle

as given in Starforged which is reprinted below.

Odds                              The answer  is  yes  if  you  roll...  MOVES

Small Chance                      10 or less

Unlikely                          25 or less

50/50                             50 or less

Likely                            75 or less

Almost Certain                    90 or less

On a match, the answer becomes extreme. This means a "yes"

becomes what is often referred to as a "yes and" while a "no"

becomes a "no and" indicating that you should ramp up the

result another notch.

Qualified answers of "yes but" and "no but" can be achieved by

rolling your action die along with the percentile dice.

If the action die shows a 6...

          A "yes" answer is unchanged.

          A "no" answer becomes "no but" which adds a logical

          narrative qualifier to the result.

If  the  action die shows a 1...

          A "no" answer is unchanged.

          A "yes" answer becomes "yes but"    which adds a      logical

          narrative qualifier to the result.

A   match on the percentile dice supersede    the action die    roll.

           ORACLE TEMPLATES

TEMPLATES  On the following pages, you will find templates for oracles of

           various percent chances. The 1%, 2%, 4%, 5%, and 10% templates

           all work out perfectly (because they are factors of 100), but I've

           also included templates for 6% and 8% where all the entries have

           that percent chance except for the last result which has a 4%

           chance in both cases. I figured that was good enough since

           many times the last result is pointing to another oracle or rolling

           twice.

           It is important to note that the original oracles didn't always

           follow a consistent pattern for percents. In many cases, the

           results had varying chances most likely because the total

           number of results desired didn't work out to be a nice factor of

           one hundred. Indeed, there are several oracles that have results

           bouncing between 3% and 4% chances seemingly to make the

           final numbers work with a 1d100 table. I really like that approach

           because it puts the emphasis on creating good results rather

           than a specific number of results. That being said, I did stick to

           consistent percent chances for these oracle templates.

           The other thing to note is that you can always combine oracles

           using the action die as a separator much I like for these

           expanded oracles. In that sense, you could have one table with

           30 results that occurs on a D6 roll of 1, another table of 40 results

           on the roll of 2-4, and a third table of 70 results that occurs on the

           roll of 5 or 6 on your D6. Feel free to create your own oracle

           chains like this if you find these blank templates too restrictive.

           Finally, there are templates for Derelict Zones and Planet

           Types included at the very end so that you can expand those

           categories even more if you'd like.
